## Mailjet Installation and Setup
Mailjet is used for email notifications and communications in this POS system.

1. Install the Mailjet NuGet package:
    ```bash
    Install-Package Mailjet.Api -Version latest
    ```
2. Configure Mailjet API keys:
   - Sign up at [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) and get your API credentials.
   - Add the credentials to your application:
     ```csharp
     using Mailjet.Client;
     using Mailjet.Client.Resources;
     using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;
     using System;
     using System.Threading.Tasks;
     
     class Program
     {
         static async Task Main(string[] args)
         {
             MailjetClient client = new MailjetClient("your-api-key", "your-secret-key");
             MailjetRequest request = new MailjetRequest
             {
                 Resource = Send.Resource,
             }
             .Property(Send.FromEmail, "your-email@example.com")
             .Property(Send.FromName, "POS System")
             .Property(Send.Subject, "Test Email")
             .Property(Send.TextPart, "Hello, this is a test email from Mailjet!")
             .Property(Send.Recipients, new JArray {
                 new JObject { { "Email", "recipient@example.com" } }
             });
             
             MailjetResponse response = await client.PostAsync(request);
             Console.WriteLine(response.StatusCode);
         }
     }
     ```
3. Use Mailjet to send email notifications for order confirmations, password resets, etc.
